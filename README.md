# 📝 MiniApp Task Manager

A full-stack project built with **React**, **GraphQL**, and **Apollo Server** to showcase the ability to design, build, and query a modern API, following the structure and skills relevant to enterprise environments.

This simulates a simplified "MiniApp" team environment with a task-tracking app that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks — demonstrating key GraphQL concepts and frontend-backend integration.
